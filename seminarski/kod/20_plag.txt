In this paper, we propose a novel plagiarism detection method that takes full advantage of
stopword occurrences in texts. Instead of following the common practice of eliminating
stopwords, the proposed method eliminates all the other tokens and is entirely based on the
remaining stopword sequences. Therefore, it is a method based exclusively on structural
information rather than content information. We show that stopword n-grams are able to
capture syntactic similarities between suspicious and original documents and they can be used
to detect the plagiarized passage boundaries. Results on a publicly-available corpus
demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach is competitive when compared
with the best reported results on the same corpus. More importantly, our method achieves
significantly better results when dealing with difficult plagiarism cases where the plagiarized
passages are highly modified and most of the words or phrases have been replaced with
synonyms.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes previous related
work. Section 3 presents the proposed method in detail. The experimental settings and results
are included in Section 4 while the conclusions drawn from this study and suggested future
work directions are given in Section 5.
